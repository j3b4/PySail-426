# GSHHG
## A Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical, High-resolution Geography Database

The files in this directory came from Ricardo Apolloni's distribution around 2012.  
He would have obtained them from the GSHH site:
http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/pwessel/gshhg/.

I have ommitted the "high" and "full" resolution versions of the cartography files
to save space. However you can obtain them from Ricardo's website in the bundle
http://riccardoapolloni.altervista.org/index.html#P8

It would also be possible to go to the GSHH website (above) and obtain updated 
files
