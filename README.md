# PySail-426
Python Sailing Simulation based on the work of the intrepid and generous Ricardo Apolloni.

Apolloni released this program as Virtual Sailing's Python Simulator on this website:
http://riccardoapolloni.altervista.org
Documentation is available there in English or Italian. 

Ricardo had already released the code under the GPL, but he graciously endorsed my request
to publish it here and begin a project of translating the code ie. comments and in some
cased variable names into English.  The motivation behind this project is to learn the code
well enough to inform my own project and possibly provide the basis for a python virtual 
sailing library for use in other projects.
